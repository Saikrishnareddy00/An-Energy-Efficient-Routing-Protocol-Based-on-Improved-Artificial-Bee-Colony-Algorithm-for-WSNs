Title: Propose VS Extension Energy Consumption Graph

X-axis (Technique Name):

"Propose Algorithm"

"Extension Algorithm"

Y-axis (Energy Consumption):

The Propose Algorithm has higher energy consumption than the Extension Algorithm.

Insight: The Extension Algorithm appears more energy-efficient.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Interpretation
This tool demonstrates an energy-efficient routing algorithm for WSNs.

It's comparing a Proposed Algorithm vs. an Extension (Optimized) Algorithm.

Likely uses Clustering techniques with Artificial Bee Colony optimization to improve energy usage.

The Extension Algorithm appears to consume less energy, which is a desired outcome in WSN design.
